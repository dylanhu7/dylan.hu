I'm currently a junior at Brown University studying computer science with a focus on computer graphics, computer vision, deep learning, and software engineering.

I am passionate about designing and building software for all kinds of communities and applications, as well as exploring the cutting-edge of research in visual computing.

In my free time, I enjoy competitive esports and learning Japanese!
